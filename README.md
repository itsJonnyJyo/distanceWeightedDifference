# distanceWeightedDifference

Consider a one-based array a of integers of arbitrary size. 
We will define the distance-weighted difference d(i,j) between a distinct pair of numbers a[i] and a[j]
in the array to be the magnitude of the difference between the numbers divided by the distance between their positions:
d(i,j) = |a[i] - a[j]| / |i - j|
